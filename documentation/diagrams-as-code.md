# Diagrams-As-Code

Living diagrams, for things such as system architectures are best tracked in a format that is approachable by non experts (for minor fixes) and facilitates collaboration. 
Following the Documentation-As-Code philosophy, these diagrams should reside close to the codebase, allowing for updates in sync alongside code changes. One of the 
most common tools is [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org)
